#Problem 1
Loading the data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(dplyr)

data("instacart")

```

Describing the data

The `Instacart` dataset has `r nrow(instacart)` observations and 15 variables. The data is structured such that each row is a product from an order, and there is one order per user of the Instacart Online Grocery Shopping service. Key variables include order_id (order identifier), product_id (product identifier), product_name, and aisle. [What does it mean, give an illustrative example of observations]?

There are `r sum(pull(instacart, aisle_id))` total aisles, and `r n_distinct(pull(instacart, aisle_id))` unique types of aisles.
