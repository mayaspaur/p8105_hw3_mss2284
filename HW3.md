Describing the data

The `Instacart` dataset has 1384617 observations and 15 variables. The
data is structured such that each row is a product from an order, and
there is one order per user of the Instacart Online Grocery Shopping
service. Key variables include order\_id (order identifier), product\_id
(product identifier), product\_name, and aisle. \[What does it mean,
give an illustrative example of observations â€“\> give example of first
item in table\]?

There are 134 unique types of aisles. The three most populare are fresh
fruits, fresh vegetables, and packaged vegetables fruits.

The `accelerometer_data` dataset has 50,400 observations and 6
variables. Data was collected on a male 63-year old patient disgnosed
with congestive heart failure and admitted to the Advanced Cardiac Care
Center of Columbia University Medical Center. Key variables include
day\_id (one day\_id corresponding to each of the 35 days of data
collection), day (day of the week), minutes, activity\_counts (total
activity for each minute of the day), and weekend (coded as weekend for
Saturday and Sunday, and weekday for Monday - Friday).
